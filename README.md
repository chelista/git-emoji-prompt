# git-emoji-prompt
A Bash Prompt for git and some emojis to keep your life interesting
    
#Background
When working with multiple branches log branch names are welcome documentation. The disadvantage is that it leaves little room for long commands. It occurred to me that a line break would be a good idea. Then, I didn't want the break line all the time so I hardcoded the path to the project. 

At the beginning I kept editing paths and sourcing different files but I quickly grew tired of that. Then, I could not just leave it alone, so during my long times of waiting for some epiphany to fix a bug was just not going to go away I though it could be cool to have some sort of pet to keep me entertained. I said the hell with the bug for the time being and added a little dog; then, a dragon, and a kittie, and a lizzard and there I went into the rabbit hole. A female friend liked the kittie and wanted to copy of the script to add give him friends. Then another friend wanted something else so I finally decided to just make a repo.

# Usage
- checkout project to directory .git-emoji-prompt
- Replace `export PS1=''` with `source ~/.git-emoji-prompt/ps1`
